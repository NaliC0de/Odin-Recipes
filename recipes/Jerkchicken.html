    <p>This jerk chicken recipe is from Paul Chung, who grew up in Jamaica and sampled jerk throughout the island. It's fragrant, fiery hot, and smoky all at once.
    <br>
        For all the depth of flavor this dish provides, Jamaican jerk chicken is fairly simple to prepare. Once you've gathered all your ingredients, everything but the chicken gets whizzed in the food processor to make a marinade. It's important to let the chicken marinate overnight, so the seasoning has time to thoroughly penetrate the meat. Then, all that's left to do is bring the chicken up to room temperature and grill it until well-browned. The chicken can also be roasted in the oven if desired.
